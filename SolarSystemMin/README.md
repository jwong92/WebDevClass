# Solar System

## Project Description

Inspired by the codepen by [Julian Garner's](https://codepen.io/juliangarnier/pen/idhuG, "Julian's System") solar system in codepen, I decided to create my own version as well. At the time, I was very fixated on learning more about space, not only because it does hold a fascination on me,but also because at the time, Elon was launching his Falcon Heavy. With everything going on around me, I was really keen to get started with this project.

I did my best to make all planets to scale in relation with each other, and to make the distance between each planet relative to each other as well. However, it wouldn't have been as presentable if both were to the same scale, so I did it separately. I also did my best to make the planets have appropriate color scheme, and rotation axis.

## Functionality
 This project is coded in pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The basis of the project was to use keyframe animations and transitions/transforms. The page is fully responsive, so you can also view it in mobile if you'd like.

 Each planet has their own description, where you can find more information if you click their associated link. Here, you'll also see a close up of the planet itself.
