# Our Solar System

### Project Description

#### Inspired by the codepen by Julian Garner's solar system in codepen, I decided to create my own version as well as part of a final project for the Web Development program at Humber. This project is coded in pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The basis of the project was to use keyframe animations and transitions/transforms.

#### I had a lot of fun doing this project, and I am incredibly satisfied with the result!
